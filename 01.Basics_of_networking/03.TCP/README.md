LEARNED:
    TCP - Connection oriented Packets sends with order numerically, receive info about packet is received. If not resends. May send twice but server pass it. Used mainly in web pages, mail services, file transfer, ssh. Doesn't support multicast or broadcast as it is bidirectional connection.
TCP has to connect() first, in background machines does 3 way handshake.


LOOKEDUP:
    //This is a spaceholder as i am writing this after completing tcp chapter. i ll add later

CHANGED:
    in client: just divided functions into files.
    in server: moved header into parent folder as creating same file each time bothered me
